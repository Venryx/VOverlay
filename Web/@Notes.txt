Packages
==========
node_modules:
* Folder for node modules that are not modified at all.
* This folder is as it should be simply by running "npm install" from "Main" folder.

node_modules_CustomExternal:
* Folder for node modules that are modified, and large/substantial enough to warrant their own folder/repo somewhere else on disk.
* These other folders/repos should be symlinked to from this folder.

node_modules_CustomInternal:
* Folder for node modules that are small enough to not have a separate folder/repo (but maybe have one in the future).
* Should be up-to-date just as part of BD repo. (this is preferred over Packages folder, which is like the "earliest state" for custom packages)
* Can make-your-own.

Packages:
* Folder for modules/packages that are small enough to not have a seprate folder/repo (and probably won't have one in the future, since probably specific to project).
* Should be up-to-date just as part of BD repo.
* Can make-your-own.

In other words) If making new package, and it's starting small: put in Packages first. Then move to node_modules_CustomInternal once progressed to use the node-modules approach. Then move to separate folder (symlinked from node_modules_CustomExternal) once gets large/substantial enough. Then move to just using npm when to the public level (i.e. accessible on npm).
